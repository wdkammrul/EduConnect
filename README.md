⚪ Unique Design and Concept:

The website boasts a unique design and concept, ensuring it stands out from existing projects and demos. The design inspiration is gathered from various sources, avoiding any replication of previous assignments.

⚪ Dynamic Home Page:

The home page features a well-structured layout with a navbar, banner/slider, services section, and footer. Active routes on the navbar enhance user navigation.


⚪ Email and Password Authentication:

Robust authentication is implemented, allowing users to register and log in using email and password. The registration page validates password criteria, and error messages are displayed on the login page for mismatches.

⚪ Persistent Login State:

Reloading private routes does not redirect users to the login page, ensuring a seamless user experience after authentication.


⚪ Custom 404 Page:

A custom 404 page is implemented, providing a user-friendly experience in case of page-not-found situations.
